# test code:

1) Python_client.py and Python_client2A.py - current program to test WiFi connectivity to Arduino. To use, input a string in the form [storLoc,pickerID,on/off] (e.g. "356,12,on").
1) SetupConn.py - example script to connect to the wms (still need the sql queries before we can use this).
